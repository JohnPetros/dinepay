## üñ•Ô∏è About the project

**DinePay** is a dapp, a web application that leverages blockchain's technology to provide features that required extra **security** and **immutability**.

In this case, DinePay allows customers to calculate, pay in [Ether](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369869912_Ethereum_Introduction_Expectation_and_Implementation), register bills and tips in the blockchain of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/). Plus, the restaurant's owner can search out of all these receipts, tranfer the amount for the respecitve waiter of a specific receipt or even pay all waiters at once, besides withdrawing the total amount that belongs to the restaurant itself. 

The goal of developing this project was to learn the basic of smarta contract development in [Solidity language](https://soliditylang.org/), also the main concepts of [Web 3](https://hbr.org/2022/05/what-is-web3) in general.

Lastly, The design of the project is based on the [Tip calculator app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX) from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), a free online platform where you can enhance you frontend development skills.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Archtecture

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies, tool e external services

This project was developed using the technolgies bellow:

- **[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)** for programming the smart contract

- **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)** for facilicating the tests, build and deploy of the smart contract

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** for building the UI with JavaScript
